# Gereksiz v0.01

I did not make this filter on my own. I used code from others, other players gave me input what items to include. 
Thanks everyone!

I make occasional changes/updates to the filter, I recommend updating it every once in a while, and every reset. 

This filter deletes inferior items as you level, test and see if you are comfortable with it.

It doesn't tell you what is the item, like some other filters. There are 3 unique categories: Purple, Red, Default color. 

Don't expect to see a lot of detail with this filter, it is meant to be a very short and lag-free filter (it has less than 400 lines, compared to 5-10k+). 
Don't ask me to add items, this is a good base filter for people to add their own items.

Good luck and have fun!
Gereksiz!
