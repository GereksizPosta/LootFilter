# Gereksiz v0.01

I made this filter, obviously used code from other filters. 

## \[[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GereksizPosta/LootFilter/master/item.filter)\]

I make occasional updates to the filter, I recommend downloading it from time to time. 

This filter deletes inferior items as you level, test and see if you are comfortable with it. 

There are 3 unique categories: Purple, Red, Default color. 

Don't expect to see a lot of detail with this filter, it is meant to be a very short and lag-free filter (it has 400 lines, compared to 5000+). 
Don't ask me to add items, this is a good base filter for people to add their own items.

Good luck and have fun!
Gereksiz!
