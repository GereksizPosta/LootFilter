I made this filter, obviously used code from other filters. 
I make occasional updates to filter, I recommend downloading it from time to time. 

This filter deletes items as you level, test and see if you are comfortable with it. 

Don't expect to see a lot of details with this filter, it is meant to be a very short and lag-free filter. 
Don't ask me to add items, this is a good base filter for people to add their own items.

Good luck and have fun!
Gereksiz!
